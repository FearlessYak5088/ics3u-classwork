# Run the program, and type in 80.5 for the current water temperature. Do Goofus and Gallant swim for the same amount of time?
# Put your answer in a comment.
# Both Goofus and Gallant swim the same amount of time (4 min)

# Run the program again, but this time enter 78 for the starting temperature. What changes?
# Gallant does not swim, and Goofus swims for 1 min. 

# Does Gallant check the water temperature first, or does he just dive right in?
# Gallant checks the temperature first

# What about Goofus? Does he check the water temperature first or just dive in?
# Goofus dives in

# What is the difference between the first while loop and the second while loop? What do you suppose the keyword break does in the second loop?
# The first while loop will work if the current temperature is greater than or equal to the minimum temperature, 
# The second while loop will work no matter what. The break keyword in the second loop stops the loop when the current temperature is less than the minimum temperature.

# One of these loops is sometimes called a “pre-test loop”, and the other is called a “post-test loop”. Which one is which?
# The first one is a pre-test loop(it checks the condition before running the loop), and the second one is a post-test loop (it checks the condition after running the loop once).
