# 1. Run both files (herons_formula.py and herons_formula_no_function.py). Do they both produce the same output? 

# Yes

# 2. How many lines long is herons_formula_no_function.py? 
# How many lines long is herons_formula.py if you don’t count the 10 lines of comments inside the triangle_area() function?

# herons_formula_no_function.py is 49 lines
# herons_formula.py is 32 lines

# 3. There is a bug in the formula for both files. When (a+b+c) is an odd number, floor-dividing by 2 throws away the .5. 
# Fix both files so that instead of (a+b+c) // 2 you have (a+b+c) / 2 everywhere it occurs. 
# Was it easier to fix the file that used a function, or the one that didn’t use a function? Answer in a comment.

# The function was easier because you just had to switch it once

# 4.Add one more test to both files: find the area of a triangle with sides 9, 9, and 9. 
# Was it difficult to add to the file that used a function? 
# Answer in a comment on the line below where you added the new function call.

# No, the function is easier because you only change one line
